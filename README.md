# du2.github.io
Welcome to the page for du2. My idea with this one is to provide programming tools and tutorials - just to get you started.

Begin by running `git clone (repos link here)` 
Cloning this repo will give you all the html files at once, but if you'd prefer to download them induvidually, do that.
