# du2.github.io
Welcome to the page for du2. My idea with this one is to provide programming tools and tutorials - just to get you started.

Begin by running `git clone https://github.com/duckebosh/du2.github.io.git` 
Cloning this repo will give you all the html files at once, but if you'd prefer to download them induvidually, do that

# Step 1

Starting is pretty simple. Just create an html file with all the required presets. Check out `default.html` to see this.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>[Enter Title Here]</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
